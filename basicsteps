1.First, cd to the directory where we want to store our code, then run django-admin startproject newapp
2.This will create a newapp directory in our current directory.
3.Then: cd newapp.
4.Now, to create our app, we run: python manage.py startapp newapp
5.Inside newapp package (containing __init__.py) create an empty celery.py file.
6.Inside the newapp package, create empty forms.py and tasks.py. The task.py is where we put the functions/codes
that need to be put in the background. These are usually slow or time-consuming tasks such as training machine learning
models. The forms.py contain the Django Forms that will be receiving input information from the user.
7.We create a template directory that will contain our simple html pages.
8.Run rabbitmq-server start .
